# Doberman

Uptime Monitor for ScottyLabs

## Launch

Run Prometheus:
```bash
podman-compose up -d
```
- Flag `-d`: detached mode; starts containers in background

Other useful commands:
```bash
podman-compose up -d --build     # rebuild and run
podman-compose down              # stop all (declared in current podman-compose.yml)
podman-compose restart           # restart services

# logs
podman-compose ps                         # show currently running services
podman-compose logs                       # show all logs
podman-compose logs <container_name>      # show logs for specific container
podman inspect network <network_name>     # show containers on network
```

Target for Grafana is `http://<VM_IP>:3000/`. (The VM's IP address can be obtained via running `ip addr show` on the VM.) Go to Dashboards > Prometheus Blackbox Exporter in the left menu for the main dashboard, > Prometheus 2.0 Stats for Prometheus metrics.

Currently, there are four alerts: `WebsiteDown` (fires if website has been down for > 1 minute), `WebsiteSlow` (fires if website takes > 5 seconds to respond),`SSLCertExpirySoon` (fires if SSL certificate is < 1 week from expiring), `WebsitePerformanceDegradation` (fires if website response time continues to increase over 5 minutes). Alertmanager should be working.

Previous test endpoints (currently unused): <http://httpstat.us/503> is expected to be down, and <https://httpbin.org/delay/6.7> is expected to be slow.

## Note
- This is the branch configured for VM deployment. If you run this branch on local, it likely won't work. Also note that podman is equivalent to docker (for our use case).

- If deploying for the first time (or after a clean reset), run the following commands to give Podman the necessary permissions to access Prometheus data:
```bash
mkdir -p data/prometheus
sudo chown -R 65534:65534 data    # assigns ownership to nobody
sudo chmod -R 777 data            # makes directory world-writable
```

## TODO

### General stuff
- [ ] Test alertmanager again, make sure it works on VM
- [ ] Make dashboard prettier (as needed)
- [ ] Fix alerts timeline short-term weird chunks (only on Jason's setup? someone else should check)
- [ ] Custom endpoints (?) - work with other teams
  - Maybe not required anymore, if we use synthetic monitoring (see below)
- [ ] Synthetic monitoring - see Slack for details (agent to intelligently detect issues/check core functionality). Playwright equivalent in Grafana = [k6 browser check](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/synthetic-monitoring/create-checks/checks/k6-browser/).

### VM stuff
- [ ] Deploy to VM
  - [ ] Set up data folder
  - [x] Increase interval between scrapes

### Done
- [x] Make alertmanager - send to Slack/Discord/etc.
  - [x] Also make sure alerts are actually reaching Grafana
- [x] Figure out how to make every alert show up on Grafana
- [x] Update this README for VM info
- [x] Github
  - [x] Update permissions to only allow pull requests
- [x] Customize alerts
  - [x] SSL expiry alert
  - [x] Performance degradation alert
  - [x] Track performance of prometheus itself as well
- [x] :p
